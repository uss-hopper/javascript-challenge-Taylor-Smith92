			[Mal suspects Inara is being forced to lure them into a trap]  Kaylee Frye: But how can you be sure Inara don't just want to see you? Sometimes people have feelings. I'm referring here to people.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Y'all were watching I take it?  Kaylee Frye: Yes?  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Did you see us fight?  Kaylee Frye: No.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Trap.

Malcolm Reynolds: We'll pass through it soon enough. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: It should have been me that got hit.  Shepherd Book: The thought... had crossed my mind.</p>
